  Title: Motion Sense
  Description: "[b][i]\"Don't move. Its explosiveness is based on movement.\"[/i][/b]\r\n\r\n[h1]About[/h1]\r\nWhen
    active, this needy module will monitor the movement of the bomb, and if you cause
    too much movement, you will get a strike for it. Keep your hands steady and only
    move the bomb if you really need to!\r\n\r\n[h1]Manual Page[/h1]\r\nThis is a
    pre-release version of the module. As such, I haven't gotten around to making
    the manual page for it yet. Just follow the instructions above for the time being!\r\n\r\n[h1]Mission
    Makers[/h1]\r\nFor those making custom missions and wanting to reference this
    module, the type name is [i][b]MotionSense[/b][/i].\r\n\r\n[h1]Addendum[/h1]\r\nFurther
    work needs to be done to the module before the full release. Let me know of any
    changes you think could improve the module."
