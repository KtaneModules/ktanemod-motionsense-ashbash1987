![Motion Sense Module](https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-motionsense/Manual/img/Component.svg "Motion Sense Module")

Motion Sense is a module using the KTaNE modkit for _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_. When active, the module will track rotational movement of the bomb, and will cause a strike if the defuser rotates the bomb too much within a given timeframe.

## The Manual

Visit https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-motionsense/Manual for a KTANE-like manual specifically for this module.

## Steam Workshop Installation

If you purchased _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, you'll be able to subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop; goto http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=742005442 to subscribe to the Motion Sense mod. This will download the module automatically for you, and will continue to download updates for the module when updates are released.

## Non-Steam Installation

If you didn't purchase _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, but you have a mod-enabled version to play on, then you can manually install the module instead of using the Steam Workshop.

Goto https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-motionsense/releases and download the latest release for the module.

Inside the *.zip file will be a folder called MotionSense; drop that folder into the `<path>/<to>/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods` folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).
